        The Force Awakens is the first film in the Star Wars sequel trilogy announced after Disney's acquisition of
        Lucasfilm in October 2012. It was produced by Abrams, his longtime collaborator Bryan Burk, and Lucasfilm
        president Kathleen Kennedy. Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan, co-writer of the original trilogy films The Empire
        Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983), rewrote an initial script by Michael Arndt. John Williams,
        composer for the previous six films, returned to compose its score. Star Wars creator George Lucas served as
        creative consultant during the film's early production. Filming began in April 2014 in Abu Dhabi and Iceland,
        with principal photography also taking place in Ireland and Pinewood Studios in England, and concluded in
        November 2014. It is the first live-action film in the franchise since Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the
        Sith, released in 2005.
