BattleShip
=======

The purpose of this exercise was to improve use of modules.  The app is a simplified version of the game Battleship. with a grid system and single-point ships (one hit and it's sunk) at random coordinates. In the terminal the user will attempt to attack the computer by entering a coordinate. If it is a hit, the console will print, “Hit”, if it is a miss, the console will print “Miss”.
